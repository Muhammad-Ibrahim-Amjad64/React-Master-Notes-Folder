// react uses special js syntax next generation javascript features  

//  What is Babel (javascript processor):
//      It is simply a tool which compiles the next generation javascript code to code that runs fines in the browser to ship code that works fine in the browser



// What is React : 
//     React is an amazing libraray to create javascript driven web applications . 
// The website feels like an app user does not reload 

// * A javascript library for building user interfaces 


//  the react Apps run on the browser not on the server  (javascript library)
// user interfaces (components)-> (header component ,sidebar component , article , aside components )



// WHY REACT ?

// It help with the problems that we encounter in normal javascript in a bigger js website you have to manually target the ui elements with dom and if oyu want ot change the structure and even if you use jquery to target element but there is always someting that you have to keep something in mind 

//* React makes the whole ui state management a non issue . is allows us to focus on our business logic istead of keeping our application from exploding 


// REACT ALTERNATIVES 

//* Angular js  
//* Vue js 



// Types of application 

// single  page applications :
//          Only 1 html page ( content is re rendered on client ) 
            // we only have 1 react dom call 
            // whole page is controlled by react 

// multi page application ( content is rendered on server )
           // one reactDOM.render call for each widgets 
           // whole page does not controlled by react
